# SHA256 Hardware Accelerated Implementation

To prevent reinventing the wheel and accelerating development. This implementation was made in reference to existing implementations like [Skordal's](https://github.com/skordal/sha256), but more so copies the implementation of [lostpfg](https://github.com/lostpfg/SHA-256-HDL) as it was the most easy to understand and mimic.
