# Hardware

**BIG CAVEAT**: A lot of the files generated that have been committed are artifacts from the build, thus they probably won't be compatible with your system. You'll have to take some time to prune them; I wanted to check it into VCS just because I have a working version at the moment.

## Organization

The following sub-repo is organized into several components:

- [Datasheets and Reference](./datasheets-and-reference/)
- [Firmware that runs on Linux](./firmware/)
- [FPGA gateware](./FPGA/)
- [Linux setup instructions](./linux/)
